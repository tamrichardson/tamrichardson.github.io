    <h2> BIO</h2>
    <p>
        Arguably the most successful of the four main grunge bands of the early ‘90s, Pearl Jam is still one of today's more successful rock outfits. 
        Pearl Jam was formed in 1990 by bassist Jeff Ament, guitarist Stone Gossard, and guitarist Mike McCready, who then recruited vocalist Eddie Vedder and drummer Dave Krusen. 
        Pearl Jam released their first album, Ten, in 1991.
        As Pearl Jam’s success grew rapidly in 1992 and 1993, the band rejected the mainstream attention they were receiving. Vedder specifically was 
        outspoken about their success, and Pearl Jam refused to put out any more music videos and boycotted Ticketmaster.
        Since its inception, Pearl Jam has sold 32 million albums in the US, including all of the band's live official bootlegs, and over 85 million copies worldwide until 2016.
